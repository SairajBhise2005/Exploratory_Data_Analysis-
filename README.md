# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project is a collection of my work on **Exploratory Data Analysis** as part of my third-semester course. The goal of this project was to explore and analyze datasets from the **Olympics** and **FIFA** to uncover insights, trends, and patterns. Over the course of multiple assignments, we evolved from analyzing the Olympics dataset to working with the FIFA dataset.

---

## Project Overview

The project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on datasets related to the **Olympics** and **FIFA**. EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process, where we summarize the main characteristics of the data, often using visual methods. The project involves:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Statistical analysis and visualization.
- Identifying trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Drawing meaningful conclusions from the data.

## Datasets Used

1. **Olympics Dataset**:
   - Contains information about Olympic events, athletes, medals, and participating countries.
   - Key features: Athlete name, country, event, medal type, year, etc.

2. **FIFA Dataset**:
   - Contains information about FIFA World Cup matches, players, teams, and statistics.
   - Key features: Player name, team, position, goals, assists, etc.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
  - NumPy (for numerical computations)
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and visualization)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Exploratory_Data_Analysis-.git
   cd Exploratory_Data_Analysis-
   ```
2. **Set Up the Environment**:
  Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook for the desired analysis;
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Olympics_Analysis/olympics_analysis.ipynb
  ```
<center>OR</center>

  ```bash
  jupyter notebook FIFA_Analysis/fifa_analysis.ipynb
  ```
**Explore the Visualizations**:<br>
  4. The visualizations are saved in the visualizations/ folder within each analysis directory.<br><br>
 
 ## Key Insights
 
### Olympics Dataset
